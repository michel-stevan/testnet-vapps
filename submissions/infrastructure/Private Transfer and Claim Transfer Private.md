## Project

### Name & Category
- **Project**: Private Transfer and Claim Transfer Private
- **Category**: infrastructure

### Description
A private transfer where neither the sender’s nor the recipient’s identity is visible on the explorer, and the recipient must manually claim the transfer. The sender must first encrypt their public balance.

### SL Integration  
How It Works:
1. Public Balance ⇒ Encrypted Balance
2. Encrypted Balance ⇒ Encrypted Transfer to Recipient
3. Recipient ⇒ Claims the Private Transfer

## Technical

### Architecture
High Hidden Balance Private Transfer

### Stack
- **Frontend**: etc
- **Backend**: Python
- **Blockchain**: others
- **Storage**: etc

### Features
1. Converts Public Balance into Encrypted Balance and transfers it privately.
2. More secure transactions, where the amount sent is hidden from everyone except the recipient.
